# UIdea #
IdeaBot add-ons package for user interfaces using Discord embeds.

## What? ##
Text commands are so last century. 
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are the future (and the past & present).

Text-based terminals were replaced by GUIs ages ago, but Discord bots still rely on text commands.
IdeaBot's UIdea package aims to fix that by using Discord embeds to offer users an intuitive and easy-to-use way to interact with the bot.

## Overview ##
UIdea is a collection of plugins, commands and reaction-commands to make user interaction easy.

UIdea is a toolkit to enable others to create UIs, so UIdea does not have any concrete commands for users.
